# 20 Answers about *Menschen & Magie*

The following 20 questions are often used to give a consise overview of a set of
house rules. They're from a blog post by Brendan S. alias Necropraxis
<http://www.necropraxis.com/2012/02/24/20-quick-questions-rules/>.

Here are my answers:


1. Ability scores generation method?

    3d6 down the line, two stats may be exchanged 1:1 if the player
    so wishes.

2. How are death and dying handled?

    *Menschen & Magie* is strictly a players handbook. It states only
    player facing rules. 
    
    Players are informed that PCs are "taken out" on going down to 
    zero HP. Meaning that their PC can't act anymore, will most likely
    be unconscious, in any case badly injured, and probably dying soon. 
    
    I want to leave this for the GM, or maybe even the players to
    work out in the actual situation.

3. What about raising the dead?

    Yes, dead can be raised, that's what Players learn from the book.
    It's probably very costly and requiring negotiations and trade
    offs.

4. How are replacement PCs handled?

    New PCs don't materialize out of thin air.
    
    Players are encouraged to have hirelings or henchmen or even more
    than one PC. Usually in a running campaign, if a player looses her
    last PC she should upgrade a henchmen. If that's not possible a
    new PC might be found at the next tavern.

5. Initiative: individual, group, or something else?

    Group initiative!

6. Are there critical hits and fumbles? How do they work?

    There might, it's up to the GM. Players are informed about the
    concept of critical hits and fumbles. In our games I usually give
    full weapon damage on a critical hit. On a fumble the PC might
    drop the weapon, a sword might break, a pole arm get stuck and so
    forth.

7. Do I get any benefits for wearing a helmet?

    Probably, it depends on the GM. Players are advised to get Helmets
    for their PCs if it fits the character concept.

8. Can I hurt my friends if I fire into melee or do something
   similarly silly?  

    Again it's up to the GM and not really covered in the sense of a
    strict rule. But players are of course reminded, that shooting at 
    people is always dangerous.

9. Will we need to run from some encounters, or will
    we be able to kill everything?

    Yes. Players are informed about old school games not being some
    kind of fair sports event. *Menschen & Magie* aims to prepare
    players to interact with a world where deadly menaces lurk.

10. Level-draining monsters: yes or no?

     Yes, players are advised to be prepared for nuisances like that.

11. Are there going to be cases where a failed save results in PC death?

     Yes, same as the above. Players are advised to use their wits,
     and pay attention to what the GM might be telegraphing through
     his descriptions.

12. How strictly are encumbrance & resources tracked?

     *Menschen & Magie* defaults to a simplified encumberance system
     keyed to 5 levels of basic move (12", 9", 6", 3", 0"). Abstract
     entities of "heavy armor", "equipment", "treasure" each let you
     drop to the next lower level. "Very heavy armor" lowers your move
     by two levels. Strength modifier adds or subtracts
     from your encumberance level. So a character with normal
     strength, full plate and a pack full of equipment could only
     carry some treasure if he's very strong.

13. Whatâ€™s required when my PC gains a level? Training? Do I get new
    spells automatically? Can it happen in the middle of an adventure, or
    do I have to wait for down time?

     PCs need a short downtime to level. It can be roleplayed, too: a
     cleric might retreat for some meditation and return a bit more
     enlightened after a couple of minutes.
     
     In our games we usually do XP and leveling as we roll up a
     session. So PCs usually are in a safe place by then.

     New spells however don't come automatically. 1st level
     magic-users get four level 1 spells for free: *read magic*, one
     spell of choice and two randomly determined spells. From then on
     spells are an in-game thing. Magic users have to find, study,
     steal or invent their spells on their own. Consequently *Menschen
     & Magie* only states 1st level spells.

14. What do I get experience for?

     Spending treasure: 1 gp = 1 XP, "overcoming" monsters: 1 HD = 100
     XP

15. How are traps located? Description, dice rolling, or some
    combination?

     Listen to the GM and describe your action!

     As there are no thieves and no dwarfs, no class in "Menschen &
     Magie" actually has an automatic trap finding skill. However
     players are informed that the GM might ask for an attribute
     check, like DEX roll under or even a saving throw if they do
     something risky.

16. Are retainers encouraged and how does morale work?

     Yes, definitely. Smart PCs have retainers. 
     
     *Menschen & Magie*
     doesn't give actual rules for morale, but players are informed, that
     morale of retainers will depend on how they're treated. 

     Also players are informed that monsters can also be intimidated.

17. How do I identify magic items?

     Has it a label? Do you recognize the smell? You could of course
     try it ... or rather ask somebody who might know better ...

18. Can I buy magic items? Oh, come on: how about just potions?

     You probably could, if you found a seller and were willing to pay
     the price ... might not be easy.

19. Can I create magic items? When and how?

     Well, folks who've got the right tools, enough time and money can
     certainly do that. Some ingredients will naturally be very hard
     to find, brewing some concoctions might be very dangerous, and
     sometimes magicks might just not work right. Are you sure you got
     the right recipe? 
     
     There's no level restriction on writing scrolls
     like in the Holmes edition.

20. What about splitting the party?

     *Menschen & Magie* focuses on quick start charater
     creation and on player advice for extended campaigns. In the
     latter splitting the party is being adressed. It's not
     discouraged, since I think the increased complexity can really
     add to the campaign. However players are being warned that a party
     split will not only likely lead to spacial deviation, but also
     temporal discrepancies. If one PC is at "yesterday" he can't just
     go and say hi to someone who's two days ahead.
     
     To facilitate rejoining a party *Menschen & Magie* gives a table
     for fast forward overland travel. It's a 2d6 table ranging
     from "your PC somehow gets lost and becomes an NPC until the
     party succeeds at finding him" to "you've found a
     magic item and arrive in safety".
