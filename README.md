# What is this?

*Menschen & Magie* is a collection of house rules  
for the original fantasy
roleplaying game, published in 1974. It's written in german.

It is compatible with the original game and all retro clones and simulacrum
games, based on the original game. If you don't know what a retro clone is, have
a look at [this
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_retro-clones).

You can have a look at the current versions of the formatted books here:

digitally and for print on demand on

# License

Most parts of *Menschen & Magie* are released under the [Open Gaming
License, OGL 1.0a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License). 
For the exact terms have a look at license.md and the front
matter of each individual PDF.

In short: You may print your own copy for private use, and you may give away or sell 
copies at cost to your friends. 

However, before you publish a derivative of *Menschen & Magie* really have
a close look at the license and the front matters of the books. You can use
most parts for your own work, but not all of it, and you might have to ask
some people for permission. 

Also, don't take for granted that I applied the OGL properly. If you
reprint these books or publish derivatives be sure that you've
understood all implications and take care for proper
application of all licenses yourself!
